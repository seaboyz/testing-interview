### 1. Can you describe your understanding of unit testing case phases?
* The first phase focuses on setting the values and conditions for the specific software application that you will test.
* The second phase is when the actual testing of the software happens
* The third phase is where you can analyze the outcome and test results.

### 2. What are the differences between acceptance and functional testing?
* Acceptance testing focuses on validation to ensure the software actually solves the problem programmers developed it to address.
* functional testing focuses on verifying if the software is meeting company requirements and functions efficiently. 

### 3. What is the purpose of mocking in relation to unit testing?
* Mocking is a common method and strategy used in unit testing because it helps with the observation process of examining software code structures and behaviors. When I have used mocking in the past, it has helped me to separate object behaviors and replace them with objects that function in similar ways. Essentially, allowing me to produce objects that simulate the same observed behaviors as actual objects. I have found this is beneficial for identifying software dependencies."

### 4. What percentage of code coverage do you think is appropriate for unit testing? Why did you choose this percentage?
* "The percentage of code coverage I might choose may vary on the software I am unit testing. Although, if I had to choose a general percentage, I would say 75% because this percentage still allows for code assessment without slowing down the unit testing process. Sometimes I also use functionality coverage during unit testing, to ensure that the code I am testing maintains its behaviors."

### 5. Are you familiar with white box testing and have you used it in your previous professional experiences?
* Example: "Yes, I have used white box testing in my previous professional experiences. Specifically, I used it to help me identify potential internal security weaknesses within the software I was unit testing and to evaluate how the code responded to different input values. Although this sometimes took longer, I found it helpful to ensure the software was ready for use after unit testing."

### 6. Describe the differences between unit, integration, smoke and regression testing for software.
* You use unit testing to narrow the focus to specific points of interaction. 
* interaction testing can examine internal interactions and functionalities within software technologies.
* Smoke testing is useful for ensuring software systems function correctly and don't stop working while in use.
* Finally, you might use regression testing after removing a bug from a software system to ensure the new code functions properly. 

### 9. Describe a challenging experience with unit testing. How did you resolve it?
